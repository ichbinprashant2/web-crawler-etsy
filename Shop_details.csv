Oh also you get a mix of light gray base and darker gray base, which I know some people are trying to match other labradorite for their designs so it's good to know. I would say it's about 50% light gray and 50% darker gray base. The darker gray isn't super dark though, it's like a few shades darker then the light gray, maybe like 3 shades at the most.
