            ","PURE SILK WRAP TOPSMade with Love :)Handle with Care :))Proud to introduce my latest style - the pure silk wrap top !!This wrap around top with a dramatic bell sleeve has been made from a recycled silk saree . Each one is unique and one-of-a-kind. These tops can be worn in several ways, they can be worn loosely open , tied in a knot at the back or wrapped around the waist firmly to adapt to your bodyline . The sleeves are loose and wide and there is a long belt on both sides which goes all the way to the back .SPECIFICATIONSColor :  Green top with a floral printSize : Free Size/ Plus SizeFABRIC : PURE SILK FABRICAlthough i have strict quality checks, and only take the best and good condition sarees to make, sometimes some garment could have some small, barely noticeable imperfection which may have been overlooked - like thread pulls , or thread marks . Mostly, the chances of this are next to none .WASH CARE INSTRUCTIONS : Gentle hand wash, Easy machine wash recommended. The best way is to just dip it in a cold bucket of water with a capful of gentle soap , let it sit for 30 mins , and then rinse it out in fresh water. Air dry and steam ironing gives it a perfect finish.Please take into consideration that the color in the pictures may vary slightly depending on the settings on your monitor. I always try my best to capture the exact shade and also mention it in the description , but the brightness/color saturation on different computers also differs at times.Thank You :))",https://i.etsystatic.com/9250306/r/il/4df396/4093741901/il_794xN.4093741901_t6b3.jpg,Clothing,"[[], []]",https://www.etsy.com/in-en/listing/1138231383/pure-silk-wrap-blouse-boho-tie-tops-for?click_key=7a712298962935ac7912675a52ef38810e5f999a%3A1138231383&click_sum=79b2b070&ref=shop_home_active_2&frs=1
